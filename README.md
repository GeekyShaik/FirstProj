To simulate a 401 Unauthorized response by defining the wrong role or excluding it, you would manually set up the `SecurityContext` for each test to represent the incorrect or missing role. Since the test class excludes the security auto-configuration, you'll need to manually insert the security context for testing purposes.

In the test class `TemplateProfileControllerTest`, add the following test method to check for a 401 Unauthorized response:

```java
@Test
public void getTemplateProfile_Returns401_Unauthorized() throws Exception {
    // Set up the SecurityContext with a wrong role
    List<GrantedAuthority> authorities = Collections.singletonList(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("ROLE_INCORRECT"));
    Authentication auth = new TestingAuthenticationToken("user", null, authorities);
    SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(auth);

    // Attempt to access the protected resource
    mockMvc.perform(get("/template-details/template-name/ECM_Delivery_NewBrnd/template-version/1")
            .headers(localTestHeaders))
            .andExpect(status().isUnauthorized());

    // Clear the security context after the test
    SecurityContextHolder.clearContext();
}
```

In this test case, we are setting up the `SecurityContext` with an incorrect role using `TestingAuthenticationToken`. Since your application's security is likely to check for specific roles, using a role that doesn't have access to the endpoint should result in a 401 Unauthorized response. Note that if your security setup returns a 403 Forbidden for users with incorrect roles, you may need to adapt the test accordingly.

However, if you want to simulate a completely unauthenticated access (which typically returns a 401 Unauthorized), you would clear the `SecurityContextHolder`, making sure that there is no authentication information present in the context:

```java
@Test
public void getTemplateProfile_Returns401_Unauthorized_WhenNoAuthentication() throws Exception {
    // Clear the SecurityContext to simulate unauthenticated access
    SecurityContextHolder.clearContext();

    // Attempt to access the protected resource without authentication
    mockMvc.perform(get("/template-details/template-name/ECM_Delivery_NewBrnd/template-version/1")
            .headers(localTestHeaders))
            .andExpect(status().isUnauthorized());
}
```

Remember to include the necessary Spring Security test dependencies in your project to use `TestingAuthenticationToken` and `SecurityContextHolder` in your tests. Adjust the test cases according to the actual security behavior of your application.
