3.1	Search in the Authoring Environment
Search allows the Message Publisher to specify criteria for ad-hoc searches of the Authoring information including variables, groups, templates, repositories, schemas, and data Gogets.  The criteria the Message Publisher is able to specify varies based upon the desired result list they specify.
Figures 3-2, 3-3 and 3-4 show an example where we specified that we want to find a template.  We know the template name contains the word, “test”, but want to know to which Schema it belongs as well as some other details. We enter Template as the Desired Result. We’re presented with a lot of available search and display fields, some of them are already selected by default. We just click in continue and in the Template Name field we enter the word “test” to search for all of the templates that contains that word on its name. We click on Search and we can see the search results with all the fields selected in the Display Search Fields section.
