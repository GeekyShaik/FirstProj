What is Authoring? 
The Authoring Environment is a combination of capabilities from USAA and a set of strategic message template design tools. Message Publishers in Member Operational Communications (MOC) use the Authoring Environment to:

define variables, schemas, test data and business rules for template profiles
define attributes and labels for interactive message composition forms
define template profiles
design message templates
validate and migrate the above deliverables
A message template (content) is a preformatted file type used to quickly create a personalized message when merged with COSA and Member data. ECT currently supports message templates from a collection of sources, including EMC xPression Design (xDesign), USAA SENDS.

A template profile (metadata) is a set of metadata and instructions which tells ECT how to execute various tasks in the message fulfillment lifecycle for a corresponding message template.

A schema is a collection of variables and their definitions which template can be associated to.
